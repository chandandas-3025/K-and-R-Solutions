# K&R "The C Programming Language" Exercise Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the exercises from "The C Programming Language" (2nd Edition) by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.

This project is a personal journey to master the C language by systematically solving every exercise in this iconic book. I am working through the book sequentially, from Chapter 1 to 8.

## About the Book

"The C Programming Language" (often referred to as K&R) is a foundational text for modern C programming. Its concise style and challenging exercises are famous for building a deep and practical understanding of the language.

## Progress

This section tracks my progress through the book. (You can update this checklist as you complete each chapter).

- [ ] **Chapter 1:** A Tutorial Introduction
- [ ] **Chapter 2:** Types, Operators, and Expressions
- [ ] **Chapter 3:** Control Flow
- [ ] **Chapter 4:** Functions and Program Structure
- [ ] **Chapter 5:** Pointers and Arrays
- [ ] **Chapter 6:** Structures
- [ ] **Chapter 7:** Input and Output
- [ ] **Chapter 8:** The UNIX System Interface

## Disclaimer

These solutions represent my own attempt at solving the exercises. They are intended for learning and reference, not as a definitive "answer key". There may be more efficient or elegant solutions, and there may even be bugs.

**Please attempt to solve the problems on your own before consulting these solutions.** The real learning comes from the struggle!

## Contributing

I appreciate the interest in helping, but this repository is primarily a log of my personal progress. Therefore, I am very specific about what contributions I will merge.

### How to Contribute

**ALL** contributions must be discussed in an "Issue" *before* a Pull Request is made.

1. **Open an Issue** and describe the change you want to make.
    - **For code:** Explain the bug you found or why your solution is better.
    - **For the README:** Explain *why* a significant change is needed (e.g., "I'd like to propose a new section for...")
2. Wait for me to approve the idea *before* you start working.

### A Quick Caution

Pull Requests that are opened without a corresponding, approved "Issue" will be closed immediately.

This policy is to prevent low-effort "spam" contributions. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Fixing minor typos or grammar in the `README.md`.
- Stylistic code changes (reformatting, renaming variables, etc.).
- Any pull request that is clearly just to get a contribution credit (e.g., for Hacktoberfest).

These types of Pull Requests will be **closed immediately and may be marked as spam.**
